## SOLID

S :
**Single Responsibility Principle** - A class must have one and only one responsibility.

O :
**Open Closed Principle** - A class must be open to extension, but closed to modification.

L :
**Liskov Substitution Principle** - An instance of type T must be able to be replaced by an instance of type G, such as G subtype of T, without this modifying the consistency of the program.

I :
**Interface Segregation Principle** - Prefer several specific interfaces for each client rather than a single general interface.

D :
**Dependency Inversion Principle** - Depend on abstractions, not implementations.
